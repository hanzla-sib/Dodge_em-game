# Dodge_em-game
The game is played in a racing arena where the player drives his brown colored car to pick the maximum rewards, avoiding a head-on collision with the blue opponent car(s) run by the computer (figure 1). The player car moves clockwise while the opponent car(s) move counter-clockwise only. When the game starts, the player is awarded three lives to collect the rewards from the arena. The player gets one reward point when his/her car picks up any rectangular-shaped gift-boxes placed at equal distances in the arena. When the player car hits the opponent car, one life is lost and the game arena is refilled with the reward gift-boxes. The score and the number of lives left are visible on the top of the screen
